                <span>
                    Situated in Mauritius is another very unique site in geology, spanning five acres under its "Seven
                    Colored Earths." These are vibrantly undulating dunes in hues of red, brown, violet, green, blue,
                    and purple. This striking phenomenon was created by the weathering of volcanic rock, resulting in
                    these distinct layers of color. Other than the Colored Earths, there is the Chamarel Waterfall,
                    which is one of the highest on the island. It has a flourishing space of nature with views and
                    scenes informative of their geological history in surroundings of very beautiful views.

                <span>
                    The Amalfi Coast is a beautiful stretch of Italian coastline in the south, known for its beautiful
                    towns overlooking the sea, stunning views over the deep blue sea, and its extensive cultural
                    history. Colorful towns like Positano and Sorrento, and the magnificent city of Naples, have
                    fairytale cliffside architecture tinted with bright colors, winding streets, and a general laid-back
                    atmosphere that betrays the Mediterranean way of life. Activities that visitors can experience
                    include hiking along the Sentiero degli Dei, literally the Path of the Gods, boat rides along its
                    coast, and indulgence in its cuisine, which abounds with fresh seafood and the ever-famous
                    Limoncello liqueur.

                <span>
                    Saturnia is a small country village in Tuscany, known for its natural hot springs. The aquamarine
                    thermal pools, supplied with sulfurous springs, are set against the picturesque backdrop of rolling
                    hills and forests to create an atmosphere of tranquility and serenity. These baths are believed to
                    be therapeutic, since their water contains minerals that can have medicinal effects on the skin and
                    the body. Visitors can relax and lounge about in the pools, which are all at a constant temperature
                    of about 99°F (37°C), set amidst the peace of a rural atmosphere. The town itself is very
                    picturesque, with medieval architecture, curving streets, and a very relaxed pace of life. Saturnia
                    is an excellent destination for those who want a little peace from the rush of everyday life, and
                    the added advantage here is healing power that's natural.
