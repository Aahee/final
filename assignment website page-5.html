                    Seoul, South Korea
                </span>

                <span>
                    Seoul is the capital city of South Korea, a modern and populous metropolis with sleek and
                    cutting-edge infrastructure, pop culture in the form of K-pop, and great street food. The largest of
                    these five grand palaces constructed by the Joseon dynasty—Gyeongbokgung Palace—displayed archetypal
                    beauty, with ornate throne halls, pavilions, and gardens. One can watch the changing of the guard
                    ceremony and view the National Folk Museum, which is a museum showcasing the history and culture of
                    the Korean people. Bukchon Hanok Village is a historic area that is very famous for its
                    well-preserved traditional Korean houses, generally called hanok; many of these beautiful and
                    centuries-long houses have become cultural centers, shops, and restaurants. Visitors can walk
                    narrow, sinuous paths and allow architectural details to seep in, tasting a semblance of traditional
                    Korean life. Myeongdong is Seoul's premier shopping district, hosting streets lined with
                    international fashion brands, cosmetics shops, and street food stalls peddling Krispy Kreme's
                    favorite Korean treats such as tteokbokki (spicy rice cakes) and odeng (fish cakes). The city is
                    also full of life with K-pop, accommodation of many entertainment agencies based in Seoul, and music
                    shows. Therefore, K-pop fans can get a view of such attractions as the SM Entertainment building and
                    the K-pop Museum to learn about the history and influence of this global phenomenon.

                    Tokyo, Japan
                </span>

                <span>
                    Tokyo, the ultramodern Japanese capital, is a high-tech, neon-lit metropolis known for its
                    cutting-edge architecture, world-class cuisine, and pop culture. The residence of the Emperor of
                    Japan, the Imperial Palace is primarily located in beautiful gardens surrounded by historic stone
                    walls and moats. One will be able to take guided tours for the palace grounds, through which one
                    could understand the history and traditions related to the Japanese imperial family. Other
                    attractions include the Sensoji Temple, the oldest in Tokyo, with its large red-colored lantern, and
                    Nakamise-dori shopping street with traditional craft shops and snack stalls. Neon lights burn
                    brightly over Shibuya Crossing, said to be one of the world's busiest intersections, and the
                    pedestrian crossing where maybe thousands of people cross together at one time. Tokyo has some of
                    the most insane pop culture, with districts like Harajuku famous for their colourful fashion and
                    Akihabara being known as the centre of anime and manga culture. One can walk into a themed cafe,
                    visit maid or butler cafes, and window shop at a large number of electronics and anime shops. Not to
                    be outdone by the city's international communities is its cuisine, with a plethora of eateries
                    serving sushi and ramen and other Japanese favorites to the very fine dining establishments like
                    Michelin-starred restaurants serving up some exquisite and innovative food.

                    Bangkok, Thailand
                </span>

                <span>
                    Bangkok, the vibrant capital of Thailand, is known for its beautiful shrines, bustling street life,
                    and exciting markets. The Grand Palace, once home to the royal family, boasts intricate Thai-style
                    architecture and hosts the top sacred Buddhist relic in Thailand—the Emerald Buddha. Views of
                    decorated throne halls, pavilions, and courtyards can be surveyed within this palace, which opens up
                    a visitor to vast exposure of attention to detail and craftsmanship. Not far away, the city's
                    largest temple complex is Wat Pho, home to a giant reclining Buddha–sized statue, 46 meters long and
                    covered with gold leaf. It also contains its school of traditional Thai massage, offering a
                    first-hand experience of this ancient healing artistry to visitors. Chatuchak Weekend Market, which
                    is one of the largest flea markets, covers more than 15,000 stalls with antiques, handicrafts,
                    clothes, and street food vendors. One can amble through the maze of vendors, further bargaining for
                    souvenirs unique enough to bring home and sample local delicacies such as moo ping, which literally
                    means grilled pork skewers, and khao niaow ma muang, which translates to sticky rice with mango.
                    There is Bangkok's famous Chinatown, by its narrow streets full of gold shops, Chinese temples, and
                    scrumptious fast food. One more thing to appeal to is the nightlife in the city; places like Khao
                    San Road and Patpong Night Market come alive at night with bars, clubs, and street performances.

                    Taipei, Taiwan
                </span>

                <span>
                    Taipei is the capital of Taiwan and a very famous city for its high-technology innovations,
                    sumptuous night markets, and exquisite food. On the list of the world's tallest buildings from 2004
                    to 2010 was Taipei 101, standing at 101 floors high. An observation deck provides a view of the
                    whole city. It has a high-speed elevator whisking one up to the observation deck to witness
                    beautiful vistas of Taipei, from its skyline to the surrounding mountains. It houses one of the
                    largest collections of Chinese art and artifacts in the world. Added to this is, of course, their
                    famouslystepped-up version of Jadeite Cabbage, which is a small-sized piece of jade delicately
                    carved into something resembling cabbage. People come to the Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall to
                    witness this heterogeneous architecture, erected in memory of the former president of the Republic
                    of China. The beautiful architecture is matched by crowds of people coming to view the changing of
                    the guard ceremony. The city is famous for its night markets, which are popular places to taste
                    local street food, buy souvenirs, and fully feel the pulse of the city. Moreover, well-known within
                    the high-tech industry, Taipei forms a base for innovation in the city with many tech enterprises
                    and startups now registering.

                    Sylhet, Nature Lovers' Paradise in Bangladesh
                    Sylhet, a beautiful city located in northeastern Bangladesh, is certainly a haven for nature lovers
                    and adventure seekers.

                    is a perfect get-away from city life.
                    The Ratargul Swamp Forest is the only freshwater swamp forest in Bangladesh, which is accessible by
                    boat and will amaze visitors with its silent waters and tall trees, basking in an array of flora and
                    fauna while one glides through. Bisanakandi, with crystal-clear water, rolling stones, and mountain
                    beauty, constitutes a perfect place to spend leisure time, relax, and engage in outdoor activities
                    along the Piyain River.
                    Jaflong, located at the northeastern corner of Sylhet, commands an excellent view of the Meghalaya
                    hills in India and the fine scenery around. This waterfall, one of the highest in Bangladesh, was a
                    popular spot for picnics and relaxation; it is situated about 3 km southeast of Madhabkunda railway
                    station in the Moulvibazar district. The said national park is one of the premier ones in
                    Bangladesh, located in the Moulvibazar district to represent one of the finest tropical rainforests
                    in the country. There is a vast array of flora and fauna in Lawachara, with special mention going to
                    the endangered red Hoolock Gibbon.
                    Sylhet is well-connected by air, railway, and road from major cities of Bangladesh. The best time to
                    visit would be from November to January as the weather is enjoyable with 23°C to 25°C in
                    temperature. In the rainy season from June to September, it again offers a very different experience
                    with greenery everywhere and less crowdedness.
                    This city caters to all sorts of accommodation facilities, ranging from budget-oriented ones to its
                    multi-starred resorts that speak volumes about high-class living. Moreover, one can get all sorts of
                    lip-smacking dishes here, such as Sylheti Paan and Hilsa fish, which are pretty famous.
                    It is this virgin beauty, rich culture, and warm hospitality that have made Sylhet one of the
                    potential tourist destinations in search of something special in Bangladesh. Be it open-air
                    activities like trekking or camping, exploring a unique part of Bangladeshi tradition and culture,
                    relaxation in a calm atmosphere, or enjoyment in riveting surroundings, Sylhet has a lot to offer.

                    Bali, Indonesia
                </span>

                <span>
                    Known as the "Island of the Gods", Bali's fame in beautiful beaches, interior lush green, and Hindu
                    temples precedes it. Tanah Lot offers views of a 16th-century temple set on a rock outcrop in the
                    sea during sunset. Its silhouette against the wrecking brows of waves presents a breathtaking view
                    of the temple during sunset. Another famous temple, Uluwatu Temple, is another iconic Balinese
                    temple perched on an ocean-facing cliff and a well-known spot for a Kecak fire dance—a mesmerizing
                    choral chant with energetic dancing. Bali is also a haven for surfers, having plenty of beaches
                    offering waves for all types of surfs—from baby to monster waves—like those in Canggu and Seminyak.
                    While it is crowned with lush rice terraces inside—notably, the unique and stepped landscapes carved
                    into hillsides, like the famous Tegalalang Rice Terraces in Gianyar near Ubud—a single reason to
                    visit Bali is the food alone. Nasi Goreng, Gado-Gado, and Bebek Betutu grant taste buds acquaintance
                    with some nice local flavors.

                    Cantonese dim sum, roasted goose, and other regional specialties. It has a clean, well-organized
                    public transportation system that includes the iconic double-decker trams and the world's longest
                    outdoor escalator system, making getting around the different parts of the city quite convenient.
